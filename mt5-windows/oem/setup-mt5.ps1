# Provisions MT5 + the ZeroMQ EA inside the dockur/windows VM.
#
# NOTE ON CONFIDENCE: run live six times against a real dockur/windows
# instance (Jake's Unraid box, 2026-09-13/14), each run fixing a real bug
# the previous one exposed. Run 6 was FULLY CLEAN end to end: MT5
# installed, the EA compiled, the startup ini auto-attached it to a chart,
# and its own [ZMQ] log confirmed "OK: ZeroMQ PULL socket bound to:
# tcp://*:5555" / "Waiting for signals from Flask..." with zero errors in
# either the Journal or Experts tabs. The firewall rule below (bug #7) is
# the one thing added after that clean run and hasn't itself been
# re-verified live, since Windows only prompts for it once per install:
#   1. mt5setup.exe's /auto flag does NOT make it fully silent -- it still
#      shows a license-agreement screen and a finish screen that each need
#      a click. First fix (tracking Start-Process's PID) was WRONG: under
#      UAC elevation that PID is the non-elevated launcher stub, which
#      exits as soon as it hands off to the real installer, so the script
#      sailed past the dialog without clicking it. Fixed to poll for the
#      setup window by title and for terminal64.exe's existence instead --
#      CONFIRMED working when run unattended from an already-elevated
#      shell with no UAC prompt in the way, which is meant to mirror
#      install.bat's normal SYSTEM/elevated execution context.
#   2. The ding9736/MQL5-ZeroMQ repo's actual layout is Core/*.mqh +
#      ZeroMQ.mqh at the repo root (the library's own README describes an
#      older "ZeroMQ folder" layout that no longer matches) -- fixed and
#      CONFIRMED (files land at $InstallDir\MQL5\Include\ZeroMQ\ZeroMQ.mqh
#      and \Core\*.mqh).
#   3. BIG one: mt5setup.exe's /dir= argument is silently IGNORED -- it
#      always installs to the fixed "C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5"
#      location below regardless of what /dir says (confirmed via the
#      installer's own per-user data-folder origin.txt, which recorded
#      that exact path even though /dir asked for C:\MT5). $InstallDir is
#      no longer a folder this script invents; it's the real install
#      location, found dynamically if the default ever changes.
#   4. Another one: metaeditor64.exe, run WITHOUT /portable, resolves the
#      EA's #include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh> (angle brackets always resolve
#      against the terminal's *assigned data folder*, never against
#      $InstallDir directly) against the normal %AppData% data folder --
#      not $InstallDir\MQL5\Include, where step 2 actually put the ZeroMQ
#      files. Compile failed with "error 106: file ... not found" even
#      though the file genuinely existed, just not where MetaEditor was
#      looking. Fixed by adding /portable to the compile invocation too,
#      matching step 6's already-portable terminal64 launch.
#   5. The installer's "Finish" screen auto-launches its own non-portable
#      terminal64 (using %AppData%, not portable mode) and opens a browser
#      to an MQL5.com registration page. The stray terminal64 is killed
#      below before our own portable launch; the browser tab is harmless
#      and left alone.
#   6. On run 4, the startup ini DID successfully auto-attach the EA
#      (Journal: "expert TradingViewZeroMQExecutor (EURUSD,M1) loaded
#      successfully") -- real progress, steps 1-5 all confirmed working.
#      But MT5's Experts log then showed it immediately failing to
#      initialize and getting removed: "cannot load '...\libzmq.dll'
#      [126]" (both DLLs verified present, correct size, right folder --
#      error 126 is Windows' "a dependency of this DLL is missing", not
#      "file not found"). libzmq.dll is a native C++ build needing the
#      Visual C++ runtime, which a fresh Windows image doesn't ship with.
#      Fixed by installing the official redistributable before the EA
#      ever tries to load it -- CONFIRMED fixed on run 6 (see above).
#   7. Binding the ZeroMQ PULL socket triggers a "Windows Security --
#      allow this app on public/private networks?" firewall prompt on
#      first launch (clicked through manually during run 6). Nothing here
#      can click that unattended for real users, and if it's never
#      answered the port may stay blocked for connections from outside
#      the VM. Added an inbound firewall rule for port 5555 ahead of time
#      so Windows never needs to ask -- not yet re-verified live.
# Watch provision.log and the Experts tab (not just the main Journal) on
# first boot, and confirm Algo Trading / DLL imports end up enabled
# (Tools > Options > Expert Advisors inside the terminal) before trusting
# this fully unattended. See docs/mt5-ea-setup.md for the manual fallback
# steps.
