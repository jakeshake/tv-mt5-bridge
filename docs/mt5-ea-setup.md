# MT5 + EA Setup (mt5-windows container)

The `mt5-windows` service runs [dockur/windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows),
which boots a real Windows VM via KVM/QEMU inside a container, then
auto-provisions it using the scripts in `mt5-windows/oem/`.

## Prerequisites

- A host with `/dev/kvm` available (Unraid: enable virtualization in BIOS;
  the same requirement as running Unraid's own VMs).
- Your own Windows 11 license. dockur/windows can install from Microsoft's
  public evaluation image, but you're responsible for licensing it for
  anything beyond evaluation use.
- Your MT5 broker login, password, and server name (from your broker, not
  from this project).

## What gets automated (`mt5-windows/oem/setup-mt5.ps1`)

1. Downloads and installs the generic MetaQuotes MT5 terminal. It actually
   lands at the fixed `C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5` location (see below
   for why), with a live fallback search if a future installer build ever
   changes that default.
2. Downloads the [ding9736/MQL5-ZeroMQ](https://github.com/ding9736/MQL5-ZeroMQ)
   library and places the headers/DLLs where the EA expects them, and
   installs the Visual C++ runtime those DLLs need (see below for why).
3. Copies in `TradingViewZeroMQExecutor.mq5` and its default `.set` preset,
   then compiles the EA headlessly via MetaEditor.
4. Writes a startup config (`$InstallDir\config\startup.ini`) that enables
   Algo Trading + DLL imports and attaches the EA to a chart, using
   `MT5_LOGIN`/`MT5_PASSWORD`/`MT5_SERVER`/`MT5_SYMBOL` from your `.env`.
5. Creates a Startup-folder shortcut so MT5 launches automatically on every
   boot with that config, in portable mode (so its MQL5 data folder is
   `$InstallDir\MQL5`, next to the binaries).

**Verified live across five separate runs** (2026-09-13/14, against a real
dockur/windows instance on Jake's Unraid box). The full pipeline -- MT5
installing, the EA compiling, and the startup ini auto-attaching it to a
chart -- was confirmed working end to end on run 4 (Journal: "expert
TradingViewZeroMQExecutor (EURUSD,M1) loaded successfully"). MT5's own
**Experts log tab** (not the main Journal tab) then surfaced one more real
bug, fixed on run 5 but not yet re-verified live. Six concrete bugs found
and fixed by actually running this:

- **`mt5setup.exe /auto` is not fully silent.** It still shows a
  license-agreement screen and a finish screen that each need a click. The
  script handles this with a SendKeys loop that depends on `install.bat`
  running elevated/as SYSTEM already (dockur/windows' normal first-logon
  context) -- SendKeys cannot dismiss an actual UAC *consent* prompt (that
  runs on the secure desktop). Confirmed working end-to-end when run
  unattended from an already-elevated shell (no UAC prompt in the way). If
  provisioning seems to hang, open the noVNC viewer and check for a stuck
  UAC dialog first.
- **The ding9736/MQL5-ZeroMQ repo's layout** is `Core/*.mqh` + `ZeroMQ.mqh`
  at the repo root, not the `Include/ZeroMQ/` layout its own README
  describes -- confirmed and fixed; verified the files land at
  `$InstallDir\MQL5\Include\ZeroMQ\ZeroMQ.mqh` and `\Core\*.mqh`.
- **`mt5setup.exe`'s `/dir=` argument is silently ignored.** No matter what
  path you pass, this installer build always puts terminal64.exe and
  metaeditor64.exe at `C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5` (confirmed by reading
  the installer's own per-user data-folder `origin.txt`, which recorded
  that real path even though `/dir` asked for something else). The script
  no longer tries to redirect the install location -- it targets the real
  default path directly, with a one-time search fallback if that default
  ever changes in a future installer build.
- **`metaeditor64.exe` needs `/portable` too, not just the terminal
  launch.** The EA's `#include <ZeroMQ/ZeroMQ.mqh>` (angle brackets) always
  resolves against whatever MQL5 data folder the terminal/editor is
  currently assigned -- without `/portable` that's the normal `%AppData%`
  data folder, not `$InstallDir\MQL5\Include` where step 2 actually placed
  the ZeroMQ files. Compile failed with `error 106: file ... not found`
  even though the file genuinely existed, just not where MetaEditor was
  looking. Confirmed fixed -- the EA compiled and auto-attached correctly
  on the next run.
- **`libzmq.dll` needs the Visual C++ runtime, which a fresh Windows image
  doesn't have.** With everything else finally working, MT5's **Experts**
  log tab (not the main Journal -- check both) showed the EA loading, then
  immediately failing: `cannot load '...\libzmq.dll' [126]`. Both DLLs
  were verified present, correct size, right folder -- error 126 means a
  *dependency* of the DLL is missing, not the DLL itself. libzmq.dll is a
  native C++ build needing `vcruntime140.dll`/`msvcp140.dll`. Fixed by
  installing the official `vc_redist.x64.exe` before the EA ever tries to
  load it. This exact fix has not yet had its own live re-run.

After first boot:

1. Open the noVNC viewer at `http://<host>:8006` to watch the Windows
   desktop directly.
2. Check `C:\OEM\provision.log` and `C:\OEM\compile.log` for errors.
3. Confirm in the terminal itself (**Tools > Options > Expert Advisors**)
   that "Allow Algo Trading" and "Allow DLL imports" are both checked, and
   that the EA shows a green face icon on its chart (not a red X).
4. Check the **Experts** tab at the bottom of the terminal (not just
   Journal) -- that's where the EA's own ZeroMQ startup log and any DLL
   load errors actually show up.

### If you're troubleshooting manually via noVNC

The noVNC session's keyboard forwarding drops the Shift modifier for
typed/pasted keystrokes in at least this setup -- `:`, uppercase letters,
and other shifted characters can arrive as their unshifted equivalent (e.g.
`:` becomes `;`, `|` becomes `\`). PowerShell commands are case-insensitive
so lowercase-only commands still work, but avoid typing colons or pipes
directly; instead `cd \` to root then use relative paths, and use the
noVNC sidebar's clipboard panel (or open Chrome inside the VM and use
"Save As" / "Open in Terminal" to avoid typing paths at all) rather than
typing a full command with special characters at the console.

## Manual fallback

If the automated startup config doesn't take effect, do this once by hand
inside the VM (via the noVNC viewer or RDP on port 3389):

1. Open MT5, log into your broker account (Login/Password/Server).
2. **Tools > Options > Expert Advisors**: check "Allow Algo Trading" and
   "Allow DLL imports".
3. Open a chart for your symbol, drag `TradingViewZeroMQExecutor` from the
   Navigator's Expert Advisors list onto it, load
   `MQL5/Presets/TradingViewZeroMQExecutor.set` in the Inputs tab.
4. Confirm "Algo Trading" is toggled on in the toolbar.

## Networking

signal-bridge connects to `ZMQ_HOST:ZMQ_PORT` (default `mt5-windows:5555`).
With the default Docker bridge network in `docker-compose.yml`, compose's
built-in DNS resolves `mt5-windows` to the right container automatically --
no extra networking setup needed for a single-host deployment.
